## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)

table4b

```

```{r}
table4b %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    c("1999", "2000"), 
    names_to = "year", 
    values_to = "population"
  )
```


```{r}
table4b %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    c("1999", "2000"), 
    names_to = "year", 
    values_to = "population"
  )

table2

table2 %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = type,
              values_from = count) %>%
  summarize(total_pop = sum(population))

```

```{r}
mtcars
```
```{r}
mtcars %>%
  rownames_to_column("model") %>% # add rownames as new variable
  mutate(hp_per_cyl = hp/cyl) %>% 
  arrange(desc(hp_per_cyl))
```
```{r}
mtcars %>% filter(hp > 105) %>% summary()
```

```{r}
mtcars %>% group_by(cyl) %>% summarize(mmpg = mean(mpg))
```

```{r}
msleep
```

```{r}
msleep %>% 
  drop_na(any_of(c("vore", "conservation", "bodywt", "brainwt"))) %>% 
  filter(conservation != "domesticated") %>% 
  mutate(brainwt_fraction = brainwt/bodywt) %>% 
  group_by(vore) %>% 
  summarize(mean_bwf = mean(brainwt_fraction))
```
